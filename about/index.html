        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>This website is part of a human factors study to improve ergonomics for the visually impaired.
           The concept originates from a <a href="https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6460-educational-technology" target="_blank"> CS 6460: Educational Technology</a> class project.
           In addition to this website, I have built a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0ICzX_vJjHwATkwU86fbXTqOgTGyMJfLvh73lRyYgIZT9Xg/viewform" target="_blank"> survey</a> to gather information for utilizing High Contrast Settings.
