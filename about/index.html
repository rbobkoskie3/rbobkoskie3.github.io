           Digital media is becoming much more than a supplement in the field of
           educational technology. Online books, journals, collaboration, and even
           graduate degrees can be obtained exclusively through digital resources.
           Indeed, pedagogy has kept pace with advances in digital technology, and
           for most, the educational experience has been enhanced. However, for those
           with a visual impairment, the ability to travel unabated in a digital world
           is rife with restrictions that limit access to information and educational
           enrichment. Although tools such as screen readers (text to speech), magnifiers,
           and high contrast settings allow the visually impaired to ride this information
           superhighway, these assistive technologies are difficult for the visually
           impaired to identify, locate, and configure. Even when configured, there are
           many differences in how assistive technologies are implemented.
           These inconsistencies further compound accessibility issues for the visually
           impaired. Introducing a standard(s) based approach for assistive technology
           would create uniformity across digital media, and would open the digital
           autobahn to the visually impaired.

           Another approach to convey information is to utilize a second sensory input.
           A technology known as sonification shows promise as an assistive technology
           to enhance learning in geometry, which is a completely visual form of mathematics.
           Sonification uses sound: frequency, amplitude and timbre to convey information.
           Sonification can increase accessibility by allowing observable objects such as curves
           in a Euclidian plane can be visualized. Sonification and Standardization of assistive
           technology are tractable, cost effective approaches to enhance pedagogy for the
           visually impaired.
